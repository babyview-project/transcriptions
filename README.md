# BabyView transcriptions
This repo contains code used to extract speech transcripts from the BabyView videos, which capture egocentric naturalistic data of infants' home environments. Our current pipeline uses the Whisper model and can be found in the `whisper_pipeline` subfolder. To extract transcripts, we're extracting the mp3 files from the current pull of unzipped raw MP4 video files (currently stored at `/ccn2/dataset/babyview/unzip_2025/babyview_main_storage` on the CCN2 cluster) and then running either the model `whisper-large-v3-turbo` or `distil-large-v3` on each audio file. Both models currently output CSV files, at the video level, with utterance-level transcripts and timestamps (current output files are at `/ccn2/dataset/babyview/outputs_20250312/transcripts` on CCN2). More information about our current pipeline is in the README within `whisper_pipeline`
